Strory
------
After crushing Gen in a long and brutal battle, Akuma finds himself internally damaged. He travels all over the world in an effort to find his bastard son Ryu in order to continue his legaacy. While on a raft sailing over the Bermuda Triangle, Akuma finds himself entangled in a powerfull vortex which transfers him to another dimension. A demension filled with many powerfull opponents for him to unleash his frustration. Akuma discovers a tournament called M.U.G.E.N where only the most powerfull fighters congregate and he hears rumors that his son, with "awakened powers" has entered. He also witnesses the arival of himself from different time streams and  Ken Masters who also seems to possess "evil intent". With a new challenge awaiting him, Akuma ventures into the tournament arena to fulfill his quest.

Fixes
-------
-Added somewhat of a damage dampener
-Fixed timing problem in the Tenma Gou Zankuu
-Made opponent turn around during MGS
-Other small fixes here and there

Why the name ZXAkuma?
---------------------
Well, truthfully in my M.U.G.E.N he is called Neo Gouki but half way through the project, I remembered that there is an auther who goes by that name. So at the last minute I came up with ZXAkuma. The Z is for zero as in Street Fighter Zero (where he is from...duh) and the X signifies a cross between many different geners.These include the marvel vs series CVS2 and my own personal style. I know its stupid but I guess I will come up with something better a little later on.

Notes
---------------
I've toned down the A.I quite a bit but just in case you want to see what he was like before, I included a hard mode .cmd file. To use it simply open his .def file and replace "cmd = ZXAkuma.cmd" with 
"cmd = ZXAkuma(hard).cmd".
